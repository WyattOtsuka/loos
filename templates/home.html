            Ok gamers, so the great overlords at Google are not super pleased with my website currently. They aren't
            allowing me to display ads right now, due to some sort of policy violation, but they refuse to tell me what
            the violation is. So an update to the previous entry, I have disabled the path to let you print your own
            word as part of the webpage, just out of precaution. However, I think the violation has something to do with
            the amount of new and original content on the page. So to remedy that, I'm going to add some. So below is
            going to be my review of the 2020 Ride Superpig. This content was made entirely by me and is entirely my
            opinion.

        <p>Hey Gamers. So this is pretty cool. What im doing right now is just setting things up for the future.
            Hopefully this project will take off, but for now, its ok if it doesn't</p>
        <br>
        <p>So What do I have done so far?? well let me tell you. First, I got flask all set up. This wasn't super hard,
            but I'm really excited about it because it's really cool what you can do, and
            it's definitely right up my ally as far as coding goes. Next, I got this page going!! Check it out! if you
            go to https://wyattotsuka.pythonanywhere.com/home/"Your word here" and you replace "Your word here"
            with a word, it will show up right here:</p>
        <br>
        </p><strong>{{input}}</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Isn't that super cool?? Alright so what's next? Right now I'm waiting on Adsense to give this site the thumbs
            up. Then (fingers crossed) You'll get to see a
            big ol' add across the top of the site. Wouldn't that be nice? Just a little something to start making some
            cash, and validate my feelings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyways, things right now probably look pretty terrible, because they are. As time goes on, I'm sure I'll
            make this look way better, but untill then <i>Oops!</i>. Thanks again for reading this whole thing.
            With much love,</p>
        <br>
