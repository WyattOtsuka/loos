        <p>Hey Gamers. So this is pretty cool. What im doing right now is just setting things up for the future. Hopefully this project will take off, but for now, its ok if it doesn't</p>
        <br>
        <p>So What do I have done so far?? well let me tell you. First, I got flask all set up. This wasn't super hard, but I'm really excited about it because it's really cool what you can do, and 
            it's definitely right up my ally as far as coding goes. Next, I got this page going!! Check it out! if you go to https://wyattotsuka.pythonanywhere.com/home/"Your word here" and you replace "Your word here" 
            with a word, it will show up right here:</p>
            <br>
        </p><strong>{{input}}</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Isn't that super cool?? Alright so what's next? Right now I'm waiting on Adsense to give this site the thumbs up. Then (fingers crossed) You'll get to see a 
            big ol' add across the top of the site. Wouldn't that be nice? Just a little something to start making some cash, and validate my feelings. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyways, things right now probably look pretty terrible, because they are. As time goes on, I'm sure I'll make this look way better, but untill then <i>Oops!</i>. Thanks again for reading this whole thing.
        With much love,</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wyatt</p>
